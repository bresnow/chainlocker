# Gunsafe
## A decentralized secure vault API built on Gun chain

- Simple API
- Local first
- No need to remember passwords, only what you named your vault
- P2P ready
- Secured with encryption provided by SEA
- Synchronization capabilities included.

Gunsafe can securely store key-value pairs of strings, objects, functions. It is offline by default, but may be paired with other instances with its `gun.gunsafe.pair()` method.

Gunsafe secures each of its vault's data with an SEA keypair generated by device/machine ID and salted with the desired name of the vault. This ensures only your device can ever decrypt your vault's data, unless you choose to pair your vault with another instance.

This makes Gunsafe relatively versitile. It could be used to create a shared chatroom, or document collaboration, for example.

> Note: gunsafe should work in a browser with a bundler of your choice, but has yet to be tested.

Since this is early release software, please use due dilligence when building with it. Please report any bugs, questions, PRs, or anything else [here](https://github.com/draeder/gunsafe).

## Install
```js
npm i gunsafe
```

# Gunsafe Example CLI
Gunsafe has an alpha-state CLI available as an example of its capabilities. You may install it with `npm i --g` if you want it available to all of your terminal windows.

## Usage
```
> gunsafe
```
Gunsafe CLI accepts commands from the terminal when it is running.

## CLI commands
### `CTRL-W` or `OPTION-BACKSPACE`
Toggle document / multiline record mode

When in this mode the first string of text entered becomes the record's name. 

The subsequent entries become the record's contents and will be save to gunsafe when you toggle out of document mode.

> Note: there are some known parsing issues that cause lines to disappear when they have certain special characters. This will be addressed.

### `CTRL-C` or `CTRL-D`
Quit gunsafe

### `keypair`
Shows your gunsafe session keypair. This is the password to your vault, so use this command with caution.

### `peers [ optional list of comma separated Gun relay peers without brackets]` 
Display (default) or set the list of peers to enable online mode.

### `pair < optional pairing key string >`
Display a pairing key to pair other instances with this one, or pass a pairing key string in to establish syncronization with another instance (local or remote).

### `put < key name string of your data > --data < your data string >`
Command to put a key-value pair to this gunsafe instance

#### `--data`
Without this argument, the entire passed in string will be used as your key name and the record will have no data, so it will be unretrievable.

### `get < key name string of desired record > [ --run ] [ --global ]`
Retrieve the stored key name's data

Optionally run the record code with `--run`. By default it will run in a local scope context in which it was envoked, but may also be run in a global context with `--global`. If the record is not code, it will return the gunsafe prompt.

The ability to run stored code adds some additional possibilities to the versatility of Gunsafe, but use with care! The `--run --global` argument uses `eval()`, for example. While the default `--run` argument runs the code in local scope context. 

> Neither approaches should be consiered 'secure', but have been provided with this CLI as a way to quickly test code snippets you may save to your gunsafe.

### `list [ --deleted ]`
List the available record key names ( default ), or optionally list only the deleted records with `--deleted`.

### `delete [ key name ]
Delete the record with the matching key name. Excluding the key name will destroy all of the records in your vault. Use caution.

## API
This is a work in progress. Documentation will be updated shortly, but for now you may reference the CLI example code for a general idea.
