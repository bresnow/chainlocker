# ChainLocker

## CLI program extending [Gun](http://www.gun.eco)

### In Development

``` yarn start ``` begins the CLI prompts.

#### What I have so far

  [x] Proof of Work like hashing produces a keypair against password and immutable machine/user info.
  [x] Encryption/ LZ-String compression traverses object values instead of stringifying objects to encrypt. Object values are not encrypted or compressed.
  [x] Started CLI functions and corresponding Gun extensions.
