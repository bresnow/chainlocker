# ChainLocker

## CLI program extending [Gun](http://www.gun.eco)

### In Development

##### What I have so far

    -   ``` yarn start ``` produces the same keypair with password="123456" with the salt being the user's immutable machine info. Keypair can be authorized against POW hash and encrypt / decrypt data with GUN.SEA/ gun.user() api.
    -   Thats it I forked it a day ago.. leave me the fuck alone.

 [Dan Raeder has a project that I forked. Until I have proper docs show him love. Guy is a monster.](https://github.com/draeder/gunsafe)
